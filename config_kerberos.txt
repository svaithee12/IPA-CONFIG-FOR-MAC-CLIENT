CONFIGURING KERBEROS IN MAC-CLIENT:

1. Mac comes with kerberos in-built.
It just needs to be configured to communicate with the IPA server.


2. Copy the krb5.conf file from the server (/etc/krb5.conf) and paste it in /Library/Preferences/edu.mit.kerberos

        The contents of the same shall look like this :
                (for a REALM : LABS.LOCAL and IPA server : ipa.labs.local)


content of edu.mit.kerberos :


[logging]
 default = FILE:/var/log/krb5libs.log
 kdc = FILE:/var/log/krb5kdc.log
 admin_server = FILE:/var/log/kadmind.log

[libdefaults]
 dns_lookup_realm = true
 dns_lookup_kdc = false
ticket_lifetime = 24h
 renew_lifetime = 7d
 forwardable = true
 default_realm = LABS.LOCAL

[realms]
LABS.LOCAL = {
  kdc = ipa.labs.local
  admin_server = ipa.labs.local
}



[domain_realm]
.labs.local = LABS.LOCAL
labs.local = LABS.LOCAL




3. RESTART the kerberos and kadmin services :


NOTE : the domain name shall be resolvable by the client .
else add it to the /etc/hosts file : "ip_address ipa.labs.local"
